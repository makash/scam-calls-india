# Scam Calls Epidemic in India

I get too many (2-3 times a day) scam calls for the DigitalArrest Scam.

I tried reporting them to the National Cybercrime Portal. But that is super cumbersome and they didn't really do anything to pursue.

I am placing my trust in data. By capturing the data, there maybe a foolproof solution in the future.

## Approach

We have the phone number of the scammers. So we start there.

- Figure out the service provider, the telco of the scammer's number
- Record when I can, or sometimes recording fails, so need to figure out why can't I record some of the calls
